# Sales-etl-analytics 

This project demonstrates a full end-to-end ETL and analytics workflow using Python and Power BI to analyze sales data from January to December 2019. I began by organizing all monthly CSV files into a single folder and used Python’s OS library to automatically loop through each file, load it, and append the results into one unified DataFrame. This automated approach eliminated the need for manual file imports and ensured scalability for larger datasets. Once all data was combined, I used Pandas for extensive cleaning and transformation, including correcting data types, handling missing values, removing invalid records, renaming inconsistent columns, and creating new calculated fields such as total sales. I also used NumPy to apply conditional logic and generate additional derived metrics. Pandas string operations and regex were used to extract features like city, month, and product information, ensuring the dataset was fully structured and ready for analysis.

After preparing the cleaned dataset, I imported it into Power BI to design an interactive dashboard that visualizes key insights across the year. The dashboard includes visuals for revenue by city, brand, and product, as well as monthly sales trends and overall performance metrics. To enhance the analytics, I created several DAX measures to calculate totals, averages, counts, and time-based metrics, enabling dynamic filtering and deeper exploration of sales patterns. These DAX formulas allowed the dashboard to respond interactively to user selections and provide clear, actionable insights. Overall, this project highlights my ability to build a complete data pipeline using Python for ETL, Pandas and NumPy for data transformation, OS for automation, and Power BI with DAX for visualization and analysis. It demonstrates strong skills in data cleaning, feature engineering, dashboard design, and end-to-end data storytelling.
